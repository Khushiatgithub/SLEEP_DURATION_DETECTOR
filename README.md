# 💤 AI-Powered Future Sleep Predictor  

## 🌟 Overview  
This project leverages machine learning to predict future sleep schedules based on daily habits such as caffeine intake, stress levels, screen time, and workload. Unlike traditional sleep trackers that analyze past data, this AI proactively forecasts potential sleep disruptions before they happen and suggests corrective actions to improve sleep quality.  

## 🚀 Features  
🔹 Personalized Predictions – Uses ML regression models to forecast changes in sleep patterns.  
🔹 Habit-Based Analysis – Considers factors like meals, work hours, and screen time.  
🔹 Proactive Recommendations – Provides insights to prevent poor sleep habits before they develop.  
🔹 Data-Driven Insights – Continuously learns and adapts to user behavior over time.  

## 🔬 How It Works  
1. User Inputs: Collects data on daily activities affecting sleep.  
2. ML Model: Trains on behavioral patterns to predict future sleep schedules.  
3. Analysis & Feedback: Suggests personalized adjustments to optimize sleep.  

## 🎯 Why This is Unique  
🔹 Unlike existing solutions that analyze past sleep data, this AI predicts future disruptions before they happen.  
🔹 Helps users build better sleep habits proactively rather than just tracking past issues.
